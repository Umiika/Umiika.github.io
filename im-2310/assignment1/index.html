              <strong>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong>
              <br>
              The first thing that I paid attention with is the gif image on the right side. This is a very interesting image of a power strip that is plugged into itself but still provides energy. I looked at this image several times over to confirm how long this gif was. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</strong>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Looked at the entire web page and saw the gif image.</li>
                <li>Repeated viewing the image to confirm how long it went. </li>
                <li>I saw there was a draggable button at the centre right of the web page.</li>
                <li>I tried to drag it around and the black border on the web page rounds off as I drag it to the right.</li>
                <li>I found that only the border was changing, the inside text stayed the same.</li>
                <li>Then I paid attention on the top left session, “Send me a letter?”</li>
                <li>The shape of the letter and the text “Send me a letter?” were both clickable.</li>
                <li>After I clicked, it brought me to a different page, the whole screen is black, and the art style became pixel style. </li>
                <li>Then, I pressed Backward button to go back to the home page. </li>
                <li>I found that the home page was reset to the way it was at the beginning. </li>
                <li>The next thing that caught my attention was the row of tick box in the middle of the page.</li>
                <li>All the boxes were interactive, and I ticked all the boxes with my mouse. </li>
                <li>I expected something new to change or pop up after all the clicks, but nothing happened and I felt a little frustrated.</li>
                <li>After that I noticed the cross icon in the top right corner of each border, just like the exit button on browser. </li>
                <li>After I clicked on it, the box I have selected and its contents disappeared. </li>
                <li>Then another border came out, it is an image of a man with his eyes closed. </li>
                <li>I closed a few more borders, an image of a cat came out. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Inline style</strong> - any CSS declared with the <em>style</em> attribute inside of a HTML element will override anything from a &lt;link&gt; import or 
              &lt;style&gt; tag
